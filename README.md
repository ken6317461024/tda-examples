# TDA

This repository is a collection of python programs written in 2020 on topological data analysis. Their purpose is to better understand how TDA works and get practice building code that implements it. The file structure is as follows: 

## Structure 

- __Complete__ contains "complete" programs. These should be stable and serve a well-defined purpose.
- __Auxilliary__ contains programs that are not directly related to TDA but are used in an integral way nonetheless. For instance, linear algebra functions that are used in homology computations. A future implementation of these TDA programs can be cleaned up significantly by importing these programs and calling the functions from them.
- __Tests__ contains programs which were used to run tests.  

## Going forward 

Specific future projects should be created in a new, fresh repository, taking from this one as needed. Ultimately, implementing TDA to solve serious mathematical programs would be much more efficient utilizing existing python TDA packages, like giotta.
